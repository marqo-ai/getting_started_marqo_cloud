Marqo add documents API specification and parameters. 

Add documents parameters	Value Type	Default Value	Description
documents	Array of objects		An array of documents. Each document is represented as a JSON object. You can optionally set a document's ID with the special _id field. The _id must be a string type. If an ID is not specified, marqo will generate one.
tensorFields	Array of Strings	[]	The fields within these documents which will be tensor fields, and therefore will have vectors generated for them. Tensor search can only be performed on these fields for these documents. Pre-filtering and lexical search are still viable on text fields which are not included in the tensorFields parameter. For the best recall and speed performance, we recommend minimising the number of different tensor fields for your index. For production use cases where speed and recall are critical, we recommend only a single tensor field for the entire index.
useExistingTensors	Boolean	false	Setting this to true will get existing tensors for unchanged fields in documents that are indexed with an id. Note: Marqo analyses the field string for updates, so Marqo can't detect a change if a URL points to a different image.
imageDownloadHeaders	Dict	null	An object that consists of key-value pair headers for image download. Can be used to authenticate the images for download.
mappings	Dict	null	An object to handle object fields in documents. Check mappings for more information. Mappings are required to create multimodal tensor combination fields - see here for more information
modelAuth	Dict	null	An object that consists of authorisation details used by Marqo to download non-publicly available models. Check here for more information.
client_batch_size	Integer	null	A Python client only helper parameter that splits up very large lists of documents into batches of a more manageable size for Marqo
