Context parameter for marqo search function.

Parameter: context

Expected value: Dictionary of "tensor":{List[{"vector": List[floats], "weight": (float)}]}

Default value: null

Context allows you to use your own vectors as context for your queries. Your vectors will be incorporated into the query using a weighted sum approach, allowing you to reduce the number of inference requests for duplicated content. The dimension of the provided vectors should be consistent with the index dimension.

Example
my_index.search(
    {"Chocolate chip cookies" :1},
    # the dimension of the vector (which is 768 here) should match the dimension of the index
    context = {"tensor": [{"vector": [0.3,] * 768, "weight" : 2}, # custom vector 1
                          {"vector": [0.12,] * 768, "weight" : -1},] # custom vector 2
    }
)
