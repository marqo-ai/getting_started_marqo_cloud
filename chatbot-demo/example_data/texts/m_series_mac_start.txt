M series Mac users
Marqo does not yet support the docker-in-docker backend configuration for the arm64 architecture. This means that if you have an M series Mac, you will also need to run marqo's backend, marqo-os, locally.

To run Marqo on an M series Mac, follow the next steps.

In one terminal run the following command to start opensearch:

docker rm -f marqo-os; docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9600:9600 -e "discovery.type=single-node" marqoai/marqo-os:0.0.3-arm
In another terminal run the following command to launch Marqo:

docker rm -f marqo; docker run --name marqo --privileged \
    -p 8882:8882 --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    -e "OPENSEARCH_URL=https://localhost:9200" \
